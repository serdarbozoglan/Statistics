A fundamental task in many statistical analyses is to characterize the location and variability of a data set. 
A further characterization of the data includes `skewness` and `kurtosis`.

Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. A distribution, or data set, is symmetric 
if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.

Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. 
That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. 
Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers. 
A uniform distribution would be the extreme case
